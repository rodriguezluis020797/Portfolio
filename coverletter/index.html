        <p>
            To whom this may concern,
            <br><br><br>
            Thank you for taking the time to look over my application and considering me for the open web developer
            position at your organization. I love that the organization is a local firm in the heart of the city as it
            is one of my favorite places and where I plan to live soon. Given the location and the job description, I am
            eager to tell you why I am the best fit for this position.
            <br><br>
            As you can see from my resume, my focus is web development. As an intern, I was exposed to the workflow in a
            professional setting and gained valuable experience in developing as a team. In school, and in my own time,
            I took the initiative to further my learning in these frameworks and technologies such as .NET, Angular, SQL
            Server, Amazon Web Services, Azure, Git, GitHub, and production deployment by doing more than what is
            expected of me. I go above and beyond in hopes that it helps to lay the groundwork to achieve senior
            engineer status and while bringing that much more expertise to my firm. Some examples of this can be found
            on my GitHub page as well. Having said that, I would not only bring theoretical knowledge, but also valuable
            applied knowledge to your team.
            <br><br>
            I am excited for the opportunity to join the team and am eager to hear back from you. If any questions
            should arise in the next few days, please do not hesitate to give me a call or email me!
            <br><br><br>
            Sincerely,
            <br>
            Luis F. Rodriguez
        </p>
